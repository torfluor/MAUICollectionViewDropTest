# MAUICollectionViewDropTest

A simple project that demonstrates how to support drag and drop of external files into a MAUI CollectionView on Windows and Mac Catalyst.

The code is based on [this blog post](https://vladislavantonyuk.github.io/articles/Drag-and-Drop-any-content-to-a-.NET-MAUI-application/) from Vladislav Antonyuk.
